They are a tribal community of hunters and bird catchers, and the origin of their name is from the [[Sanskrit]] ''vyadka'', meaning one who pierces. They are mainly involved in bird catching, extracting honey from beehives and picking peacock feathers for the manufacture of fans. \\n\\nThey are divided into a six groups, theGehlot (sub cast of [http://kalgati.wikidot.com/rajput baheliya] ), Sisodia(sub cast of [http://kalgati.wikidot.com/rajput baheliya]), Karaul, Pasi and the Muslim Baheliya.  Other minor clans include the Chandel and Srivastav. Each of these groups claim a [[Rajput]] origin, with the Sisodia claiming to be superior over the other groupings.Other Surname in common is Bahel which this community uses.  All these groups intermarry, except the Muslim Baheliya.  They are found throughout Uttar Pradesh, and speak the various dialects of [[Hindi]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />\\n\\nWhile Prithiviraj Chauhan was defeated,these Rajput Soldiers from his team had to hide in forest,leaving them no proper food for survival..This is how they started hunting for their meals which ultimately turned out to be their profession & they became a well known Hunters community.\\n\\n==Present circumstances==\\n\\nTraditionally the Baheliya economic activity revolved around bird catching and selling honey. In addition, their main economic activity remains manufacturing fans from peacock feathers. These fans are then sold to [[Bania (caste)|Bania]] middlemen, who sell them on in cities such as [[Kolkata]] and [[Delhi]] Each of their settlement contains an informal caste council, known as a biradari panchayat.  This consist of five members who are elected by community members. The panchayat acts as instrument of social control, dealing with issues such as divorce and adultery.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\\n\\nThe [[2011 Census of India]] for Uttar Pradesh showed the Baheliya population as 143,442.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/SC_ST/PCA-A10/SC-0900-PCA-A-10-ddw.xlsx |title= A-10 Individual Scheduled Caste Primary Census Abstract Data and its Appendix -

They are a tribal community of hunters and bird catchers, and the origin of their name is from the [[Sanskrit]] ''vyadka'', meaning one who pierces. They are mainly involved in bird catching, extracting honey from beehives and picking peacock feathers for the manufacture of fans. \\n\\nThey are divided into a six groups, theGehlot (sub cast of [http://kalgati.wikidot.com/rajput baheliya] ), Sisodia(sub cast of [http://kalgati.wikidot.com/rajput baheliya]), Karaul, Pasi and the Muslim Baheliya.  Other minor clans include the Chandel and Srivastav. Each of these groups claim a [[Rajput]] origin, with the Sisodia claiming to be superior over the other groupings.Other Surname in common is Bahel which this community uses.  All these groups intermarry, except the Muslim Baheliya.  They are found throughout Uttar Pradesh, and speak the various dialects of [[Hindi]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />\\n\\nWhile Prithiviraj Chauhan was defeated,these Rajput Soldiers from his team had to hide in forest,leaving them no proper food for survival..This is how they started hunting for their meals which ultimately turned out to be their profession & they became a well known Hunters community.\\n\\n==Present circumstances==\\n\\nTraditionally the Baheliya economic activity revolved around bird catching and selling honey. In addition, their main economic activity remains manufacturing fans from peacock feathers. These fans are then sold to [[Bania (caste)|Bania]] middlemen, who sell them on in cities such as [[Kolkata]] and [[Delhi]] Each of their settlement contains an informal caste council, known as a biradari panchayat.

He was a member of the [[House of Gl\\u00fccksburg]] and the first monarch since King [[Frederick VII of Denmark|Frederick VII]] to have actually been born into the [[Danish royal family]]; both his father and his grandfather were born as princes of a ducal family from [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]]. Among his siblings was King [[Haakon VII of Norway]]. \\n\\nHis character has been described as authoritarian and he strongly stressed the importance of royal dignity and power. His reluctance to fully embrace democracy resulted in the [[Easter Crisis of 1920]], in which he dismissed the democratically elected [[Social Liberal Party (Denmark)|Social Liberal]] cabinet with which he disagreed, and instated one of his own choosing. This was in accordance with the letter of the constitution, but the principle of [[parliamentarianism]] had been considered a constitutional custom since 1901. Faced with mass demonstrations, a general strike organized by the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] and the risk of the monarchy being overthrown he was forced to accept that a monarch could not keep a government in office against the will of parliament, as well as his reduced role as a symbolic [[head of state]].\\n\\nDuring the [[German occupation of Denmark]], Christian become a popular symbol of resistance, particularly because of the symbolic value of the fact that he rode every day through the streets of Copenhagen unaccompanied by guards. With a reign spanning two world wars, and his role as a rallying symbol for Danish national sentiment during the German occupation, he became one of the most popular Danish monarchs of modern times.\\n\\n==Early life==\\nChristian was born on 26 September 1870 at [[Charlottenlund Palace]] in [[Gentofte Municipality]] north of [[Copenhagen]], during the reign of his paternal grandfather, [[Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]].

He had been returning from a recuperation stay in [[Nice]], France, and was staying anonymously in the city before continuing to [[Copenhagen]]. Christian was in [[Copenhagen]] when he heard about his father's demise and acceded to the throne as Christian X.\\n\\n===Easter Crisis of 1920===\\n{{Main|Easter Crisis of 1920}}\\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00617A, Kaiser Wilhelm II. und Christian X..jpg|thumb|King Christian and the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor]] during a visit to [[Berlin]] in 1913|alt=]]\\n\\nIn April 1920, Christian instigated the Easter Crisis, perhaps the most decisive event in the evolution of the Danish monarchy in the Twentieth Century. The immediate cause was a conflict between the King and the cabinet over the reunification with Denmark of [[Schleswig]], a former Danish [[fiefdom]], which had been lost to [[Prussia]] during the [[Second War of Schleswig]]. Danish claims to the region persisted to the end of [[World War I]], at which time the defeat of the Germans made it possible to resolve the dispute. According to the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the disposition of Schleswig was to be determined by two [[plebiscite]]s: one in Northern Schleswig (Denmark's [[South Jutland County]] 1971\\u20132006), the other in Central Schleswig (today part of the German state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]). No plebiscite was planned for Southern Schleswig, as it was dominated by an ethnic German majority and, in accordance with prevailing sentiment of the times, remained part of the post-war German state.\\n\\nIn Northern Schleswig, seventy-five percent voted for reunification with Denmark and twenty-five percent for remaining with Germany. In this vote, the entire region was considered to be an indivisible unit, and the entire region was awarded to Denmark. In Central Schleswig, the situation was reversed with eighty percent voting for Germany and twenty percent for Denmark. In this vote, each municipality decided its own future, and German majorities prevailed everywhere. In light of these results, the government of Prime Minister [[Carl Theodor Zahle]] determined that reunification with Northern Schleswig could go forward, while Central Schleswig would remain under German control.\\n\\nMany Danish nationalists felt that at least the city of [[Flensburg]], in Central Schleswig, should be returned to Denmark regardless of the plebiscite's results, due to the sizeable Danish minority there and a general desire to see Germany permanently weakened in the future. Christian X agreed with these sentiments, and ordered Prime Minister Zahle to include Flensburg in the re-unification process. As Denmark had been operating as a [[parliamentary democracy]] since the [[Cabinet of Deuntzer]] in 1901, Zahle felt he was under no obligation to comply. He refused the order and resigned several days later after a heated exchange with the King.\\n\\nSubsequently, Christian X dismissed the rest of the cabinet and replaced it with a de facto conservative caretaker cabinet. The dismissal caused demonstrations and an almost revolutionary atmosphere in Denmark, and for several days the future of the monarchy seemed very much in doubt. In light of this, negotiations were opened between the King and members of the [[Social Democrats]]. Faced with the potential overthrow of the Danish crown, Christian X stood down and dismissed his own government, installing a compromise cabinet until elections could be held later that year. \\n\\nTo date, this is the last time a sitting Danish monarch has attempted to take political action without the full support of parliament. Following the crisis, Christian X bowed fully to his drastically reduced status, and spent the last quarter-century of his rule as a model constitutional monarch.\\n\\n===World War II===\\n[[File:Christian X.jpg|thumb|upright|During the German [[Denmark in World War II|occupation of Denmark]], the King's daily ride through Copenhagen became a symbol of Danish sovereignty.

Christian X quickly realized that Denmark was in an impossible position. Its territory and population were far too small to hold out against Germany for any sustained period of time. Its flat land would have resulted in it being easily overrun by German [[panzer]]s; [[Jutland]], for instance, would have been overrun in short order by a panzer attack from [[Schleswig-Holstein]] immediately to the south.

This perceived slight, known as the [[Telegram Crisis]], greatly outraged Hitler and he immediately recalled his ambassador from Copenhagen and expelled the Danish ambassador from Germany. German pressure then resulted in the dismissal of the government led by [[Vilhelm Buhl]] and its replacement with a new cabinet led by non-party member and veteran diplomat [[Erik Scavenius]], whom the Germans expected to be more cooperative.

This made Christian the king of the mostly autonomous [[Kingdom of Iceland]] in addition to being King of Denmark. Christian (whose name in Iceland was officially ''Kristj\\u00e1n X'') was the first and only monarch to ever reign over Iceland as a sovereign kingdom as opposed to ruling it as a province of a larger kingdom. In 1941, after the German occupation of Denmark and the [[Occupation of Iceland|Allied occupation of Iceland]], the Icelandic government concluded that Christian was unable to perform his duties as head of state of Iceland, and thus appointed [[Sveinn Bj\\u00f6rnsson]] as [[regent]] to act as provisional head of state. Sveinn had previously been Iceland's ambassador in Copenhagen.\\n\\nIn 1944, while Denmark was still under German occupation, Icelanders voted in a plebiscite to sever all ties with the King of Denmark and to found a [[republic]]. Thus, Christian's title as King of Iceland became null and void and Sveinn Bj\\u00f6rnsson was elected the first [[President of Iceland]] by the [[Althing|Icelandic parliament]]. Christian, who believed that Sveinn had given him assurances that Iceland would not make further moves toward independence while the occupation was ongoing, felt quite badly betrayed. However, at the urging of his relative, the King of Sweden, Christian still accepted the outcome and sent a message of congratulations to Iceland during the celebration of the founding of the Republic on 17 June 1944. The reading of the King's letter provoked cheers at [[\\u00deingvellir]] during the celebration. Despite this implicit acceptance of Iceland's independence, Christian never actually stopped using the title \\\"King of Iceland\\\", and continued including it in his regnal name until his death in 1947.\\n\\n===Death===\\nOn his death in [[Amalienborg Palace]], Copenhagen, in 1947, Christian X was [[interred]] along other members of the Danish royal family in [[Roskilde Cathedral]] near Copenhagen. Although he had been behind the politics of Erik Scavenius, a cloth armband of the type worn by members of the [[Danish resistance movement]] was placed on his coffin at ''[[castrum doloris]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diis.dk/graphics/CVer/Personlige_CVer/Holocaust_and_Genocide/Publikationer/holocaust_DK_kap_5.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716022617/http://www.diis.dk/graphics/CVer/Personlige_CVer/Holocaust_and_Genocide/Publikationer/holocaust_DK_kap_5.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>[http://kongehuset.dk/publish.php?dogtag=k_en_his_chrx Official website of the Danish Monarchy \\u2013 Biography of King Christian X] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125000024/http://kongehuset.dk/publish.php?dogtag=k_en_his_chrx |date=25 November 2010 }}</ref>\\n\\n==Legends==\\nOn 22 November 1942, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published a photograph of Christian X; calling him, facetiously, a victim of [[Hitler]], and stating that the nation of this monarch did not oppose German occupation with arms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vilhj\\u00e1lmsson|first1=Vilhj\\u00e1lmur \\u00d6rn|editor1-last=Bastholm Jensen|editor1-first=Mette|editor2-last=Jensen|editor2-first=Steven B.|title=Denmark and the Holocaust|journal=In: Bastholm Jensen, Mette & Steven B.

One apocryphal story relates that one day, a German soldier remarked to a young boy that he found it odd that the King would ride with no bodyguard. The boy reportedly replied, \\\"All of Denmark is his bodyguard.\\\" This story was recounted in [[Nathaniel Benchley]]'s bestselling book ''Bright Candles'' as well as in [[Lois Lowry]]'s book ''[[Number the Stars]]''. The contemporary patriotic song ''\\\"Der rider en Konge\\\"''<!--contemporary Danish spelling--> (''There Rides a King'') centers on the King's rides. In this song, the narrator replies to a foreigner's inquiry about the King's lack of a guard that \\\"he is our freest man\\\" and that the King is not shielded by physical force but that \\\"hearts guard the king of Denmark.\\\"<ref>\\\"Der rider en Konge\\\".

The King riding by and seeing the flag, tells a German sentry that this is a violation of the armistice agreement and that the flag must be taken down. The sentry replies that this will not be done. The King then says if the flag is not taken down, he will send a Danish soldier to take it down. The sentry responds, \\\"The soldier will be shot.\\\" The King replies \\\"the Danish soldier will be me.\\\" According to the story, the flag was taken down.\\n\\nKing Christian X became the hero of a number of myths about his defense of the Danish Jews. He became the subject of a persistent [[urban legend]] according to which, during [[Nazi]] occupation, he donned the [[Star of David]] in solidarity with the Danish Jews. Danish Jews were not forced to wear the [[Star of David]]. However, the legend likely stems from a 1942 British report that claimed he threatened to don the star if this was forced upon Danish Jews, and was popularised when it was included in [[Leon Uris]]'s best-selling novel, ''[[Exodus (Uris novel)|Exodus]]''.<ref>[http://www.b.dk/nationalt/islandsk-forsker-christian-x-red-aldrig-med-joede-armbind Islandsk forsker: Christian X red aldrig med j\\u00f8de-armbind \\u2013 Nationalt | www.b.dk<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This is also supported by the King's personal diary, where the following entry can be found: \\\"When you look at the inhumane treatment of Jews, not only in Germany but occupied countries as well, you start worrying that such a demand might also be put on us, but we must clearly refuse such this due to their protection under the Danish constitution.

Denmark]] from 1912 to 1947, and the only [[King of Iceland]] (where the name was officially '''Kristj\\u00e1n X''') between 1918 and 1944. He was a member of the [[House of Gl\\u00fccksburg]] and the first monarch since King [[Frederick VII of Denmark|Frederick VII]] to have actually been born into the [[Danish royal family]]; both his father and his grandfather were born as princes of a ducal family from [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]]. Among his siblings was King [[Haakon VII of Norway]]. \\n\\nHis character has been described as authoritarian and he strongly stressed the importance of royal dignity and power. His reluctance to fully embrace democracy resulted in the [[Easter Crisis of 1920]], in which he dismissed the democratically elected [[Social Liberal Party (Denmark)|Social Liberal]] cabinet with which he disagreed, and instated one of his own choosing. This was in accordance with the letter of the constitution, but the principle of [[parliamentarianism]] had been considered a constitutional custom since 1901. Faced with mass demonstrations, a general strike organized by the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] and the risk of the monarchy being overthrown he was forced to accept that a monarch could not keep a government in office against the will of parliament, as well as his reduced role as a symbolic [[head of state]].\\n\\nDuring the [[German occupation of Denmark]], Christian become a popular symbol of resistance, particularly because of the symbolic value of the fact that he rode every day through the streets of Copenhagen unaccompanied by guards. With a reign spanning two world wars, and his role as a rallying symbol for Danish national sentiment during the German occupation, he became one of the most popular Danish monarchs of modern times.\\n\\n==Early life==\\nChristian was born on 26 September 1870 at [[Charlottenlund Palace]] in [[Gentofte Municipality]] north of [[Copenhagen]], during the reign of his paternal grandfather, [[Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]]. He was born as the oldest son and child of [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark]] and his wife [[Louise of Sweden]], only surviving child of [[Charles XV of Sweden|King Charles XV of Sweden]]. He was baptised in the Chapel of [[Christiansborg Palace]] on 31 October 1870 by the [[Diocese of Zealand|Bishop of Zealand]], [[Hans Lassen Martensen]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Allerh. approb.

They had two sons:\\n\\n* Prince Frederick (1899\\u20131972), later King [[Frederick IX of Denmark]]\\n* Prince Knud (1900\\u20131976), later [[Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark]]\\n\\nThe couple were given Christian VIII's Palace at [[Amalienborg Palace]] in Copenhagen as their residence and [[Sorgenfri Palace]] north of Copenhagen as a summer residence.

In 1914, the King also built the [[villa]] [[Klitg\\u00e5rden]] in [[Skagen]].\\n\\n===Crown Prince===\\nOn 29 January 1906, King Christian IX died, and Christian's father ascended the throne as King Frederick VIII.

He had been returning from a recuperation stay in [[Nice]], France, and was staying anonymously in the city before continuing to [[Copenhagen]]. Christian was in [[Copenhagen]] when he heard about his father's demise and acceded to the throne as Christian X.\\n\\n===Easter Crisis of 1920===\\n{{Main|Easter Crisis of 1920}}\\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00617A, Kaiser Wilhelm II. und Christian X..jpg|thumb|King Christian and the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor]] during a visit to [[Berlin]] in 1913|alt=]]\\n\\nIn April 1920, Christian instigated the Easter Crisis, perhaps the most decisive event in the evolution of the Danish monarchy in the Twentieth Century. The immediate cause was a conflict between the King and the cabinet over the reunification with Denmark of [[Schleswig]], a former Danish [[fiefdom]], which had been lost to [[Prussia]] during the [[Second War of Schleswig]]. Danish claims to the region persisted to the end of [[World War I]], at which time the defeat of the Germans made it possible to resolve the dispute. According to the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the disposition of Schleswig was to be determined by two [[plebiscite]]s: one in Northern Schleswig (Denmark's [[South Jutland County]] 1971\\u20132006), the other in Central Schleswig (today part of the German state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]). No plebiscite was planned for Southern Schleswig, as it was dominated by an ethnic German majority and, in accordance with prevailing sentiment of the times, remained part of the post-war German state.\\n\\nIn Northern Schleswig, seventy-five percent voted for reunification with Denmark and twenty-five percent for remaining with Germany. In this vote, the entire region was considered to be an indivisible unit, and the entire region was awarded to Denmark. In Central Schleswig, the situation was reversed with eighty percent voting for Germany and twenty percent for Denmark. In this vote, each municipality decided its own future, and German majorities prevailed everywhere. In light of these results, the government of Prime Minister [[Carl Theodor Zahle]] determined that reunification with Northern Schleswig could go forward, while Central Schleswig would remain under German control.\\n\\nMany Danish nationalists felt that at least the city of [[Flensburg]], in Central Schleswig, should be returned to Denmark regardless of the plebiscite's results, due to the sizeable Danish minority there and a general desire to see Germany permanently weakened in the future. Christian X agreed with these sentiments, and ordered Prime Minister Zahle to include Flensburg in the re-unification process. As Denmark had been operating as a [[parliamentary democracy]] since the [[Cabinet of Deuntzer]] in 1901, Zahle felt he was under no obligation to comply. He refused the order and resigned several days later after a heated exchange with the King.\\n\\nSubsequently, Christian X dismissed the rest of the cabinet and replaced it with a de facto conservative caretaker cabinet. The dismissal caused demonstrations and an almost revolutionary atmosphere in Denmark, and for several days the future of the monarchy seemed very much in doubt. In light of this, negotiations were opened between the King and members of the [[Social Democrats]]. Faced with the potential overthrow of the Danish crown, Christian X stood down and dismissed his own government, installing a compromise cabinet until elections could be held later that year. \\n\\nTo date, this is the last time a sitting Danish monarch has attempted to take political action without the full support of parliament. Following the crisis, Christian X bowed fully to his drastically reduced status, and spent the last quarter-century of his rule as a model constitutional monarch.\\n\\n===World War II===\\n[[File:Christian X.jpg|thumb|upright|During the German [[Denmark in World War II|occupation of Denmark]], the King's daily ride through Copenhagen became a symbol of Danish sovereignty.

Christian X quickly realized that Denmark was in an impossible position. Its territory and population were far too small to hold out against Germany for any sustained period of time. Its flat land would have resulted in it being easily overrun by German [[panzer]]s; [[Jutland]], for instance, would have been overrun in short order by a panzer attack from [[Schleswig-Holstein]] immediately to the south. Unlike its Nordic neighbors, Denmark had no mountain ranges from which a drawn-out resistance could be mounted against the German army.<ref name=\\\"RiseFall\\\">William Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'' (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1990), p. 663.</ref>  With no prospect of being able to hold out for any length of time, and faced with the explicit threat of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' bombing the civilian population of [[Copenhagen]], and with only one general in favor of continuing to fight, Christian X and the entire Danish government capitulated at about 6&nbsp;am,<ref>[[Peter Rochegune Munch]]: Erindringer 7, p. 29.</ref> in exchange for retaining political independence in domestic matters,<ref>[http://www.milhist.dk/besattelsen/9april/9april.html The German occupation of Denmark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015025325/http://www.milhist.dk/besattelsen/9april/9april.html |date=15 October 2013 }}</ref> beginning the [[Denmark in World War II|occupation of Denmark]], which lasted until 5 May 1945.\\n\\nIn contrast to his brother, [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII of Norway]], and [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]], [[George II of Greece|King George II of Greece]], [[Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg]], [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II of Yugoslavia]], [[Edvard Bene\\u0161|President Edvard Bene\\u0161 of Czechoslovakia]] and [[W\\u0142adys\\u0142aw Raczkiewicz|President W\\u0142adys\\u0142aw Raczkiewicz of Poland]], all of whom went into [[exile]] during the Nazi occupation of their countries, Christian X (like [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III of Belgium]]) remained in his capital throughout the [[occupation of Denmark]], being to the Danish people a visible symbol of the national cause (Haakon escaped the German advance after [[Haakon VII of Norway#Resistance during World War II|refusing to accept a Nazi-friendly puppet regime]].)\\n\\n[[File:Kongem\\u00e6rker.jpg|thumb|Two versions of the King's Emblem Pin (''Kongem\\u00e6rket''), showing Christian's CX [[royal cypher|cypher]]; a popular symbol of patriotism during the war|alt=]]\\n\\nUntil the [[Occupation of Denmark#Increasing resistance|imposition of martial law]] by Germany in August 1943, Christian's official speeches reflected the government's official policy of cooperation with the occupying forces, but this did not prevent his being seen by the Danish people as a man of \\\"mental resistance.\\\" During the first two years of the German occupation, in spite of his age and the precarious situation, he nonetheless took a daily ride on his horse, Jubilee, through Copenhagen, unaccompanied by a groom, let alone by a guard.

This perceived slight, known as the [[Telegram Crisis]], greatly outraged Hitler and he immediately recalled his ambassador from Copenhagen and expelled the Danish ambassador from Germany. German pressure then resulted in the dismissal of the government led by [[Vilhelm Buhl]] and its replacement with a new cabinet led by non-party member and veteran diplomat [[Erik Scavenius]], whom the Germans expected to be more cooperative. (In any event, whatever independence Denmark had been able to maintain during the first years of the occupation ended abruptly with the German ''putsch'' in August 1943.)

This made Christian the king of the mostly autonomous [[Kingdom of Iceland]] in addition to being King of Denmark. Christian (whose name in Iceland was officially ''Kristj\\u00e1n X'') was the first and only monarch to ever reign over Iceland as a sovereign kingdom as opposed to ruling it as a province of a larger kingdom. In 1941, after the German occupation of Denmark and the [[Occupation of Iceland|Allied occupation of Iceland]], the Icelandic government concluded that Christian was unable to perform his duties as head of state of Iceland, and thus appointed [[Sveinn Bj\\u00f6rnsson]] as [[regent]] to act as provisional head of state. Sveinn had previously been Iceland's ambassador in Copenhagen.\\n\\nIn 1944, while Denmark was still under German occupation, Icelanders voted in a plebiscite to sever all ties with the King of Denmark and to found a [[republic]]. Thus, Christian's title as King of Iceland became null and void and Sveinn Bj\\u00f6rnsson was elected the first [[President of Iceland]] by the [[Althing|Icelandic parliament]]. Christian, who believed that Sveinn had given him assurances that Iceland would not make further moves toward independence while the occupation was ongoing, felt quite badly betrayed. However, at the urging of his relative, the King of Sweden, Christian still accepted the outcome and sent a message of congratulations to Iceland during the celebration of the founding of the Republic on 17 June 1944. The reading of the King's letter provoked cheers at [[\\u00deingvellir]] during the celebration. Despite this implicit acceptance of Iceland's independence, Christian never actually stopped using the title \\\"King of Iceland\\\", and continued including it in his regnal name until his death in 1947.\\n\\n===Death===\\nOn his death in [[Amalienborg Palace]], Copenhagen, in 1947, Christian X was [[interred]] along other members of the Danish royal family in [[Roskilde Cathedral]] near Copenhagen.

The contemporary patriotic song ''\\\"Der rider en Konge\\\"''<!--contemporary Danish spelling--> (''There Rides a King'') centers on the King's rides. In this song, the narrator replies to a foreigner's inquiry about the King's lack of a guard that \\\"he is our freest man\\\" and that the King is not shielded by physical force but that \\\"hearts guard the king of Denmark.\\\"<ref>\\\"Der rider en Konge\\\".

The King riding by and seeing the flag, tells a German sentry that this is a violation of the armistice agreement and that the flag must be taken down. The sentry replies that this will not be done. The King then says if the flag is not taken down, he will send a Danish soldier to take it down. The sentry responds, \\\"The soldier will be shot.\\\" The King replies \\\"the Danish soldier will be me.\\\" According to the story, the flag was taken down.\\n\\nKing Christian X became the hero of a number of myths about his defense of the Danish Jews. He became the subject of a persistent [[urban legend]] according to which, during [[Nazi]] occupation, he donned the [[Star of David]] in solidarity with the Danish Jews. Danish Jews were not forced to wear the [[Star of David]]. However, the legend likely stems from a 1942 British report that claimed he threatened to don the star if this was forced upon Danish Jews, and was popularised when it was included in [[Leon Uris]]'s best-selling novel, ''[[Exodus (Uris novel)|Exodus]]''.<ref>[http://www.b.dk/nationalt/islandsk-forsker-christian-x-red-aldrig-med-joede-armbind Islandsk forsker: Christian X red aldrig med j\\u00f8de-armbind \\u2013 Nationalt | www.b.dk<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This is also supported by the King's personal diary, where the following entry can be found: \\\"When you look at the inhumane treatment of Jews, not only in Germany but occupied countries as well, you start worrying that such a demand might also be put on us, but we must clearly refuse such this due to their protection under the Danish constitution.

These fall into two categories: diagnostic findings and physically visible symptoms.\\n\\n===Diagnostic findings===\\nSymptoms categorized as medically tested and diagnosed include iron accumulation in the brain, basal ganglia [[cavitation]], and [[neurodegeneration]].<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy- Summary of published data\\\"/> Patients who are diagnosed with neuroferritinopathy have abnormal iron accumulation in the brain within the [[neurons]] and [[glia]] of the [[striatum]] and cerebellar cortices.<ref name = \\\"Zecca\\\"/> Along with the accumulation of iron in the brain, neuroferritinopathy typically causes severe neuronal loss as well.<ref name = \\\"Zecca\\\"/> \\nSecondary symptoms may also arise. It is possible that the initial iron accumulation will cause additional neuronal damage and neuronal death.<ref name = \\\"Zecca\\\"/> The damaged neurons may be replaced by other cells in an effort to reverse the neurodegeneration. These cells often have a higher iron content. The breakdown of the [[blood brain barrier]] may also occur due to the loss of neurons and will subsequently allow more iron to access the brain and accumulate over time.<ref name = \\\"Zecca\\\"/>\\n\\nNeuroferritinopathy is mainly seen in those who have reached late adulthood and is generally seen to slowly progress throughout many decades in a lifetime with the mean age of onset being 39 years old.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\"/> A loss of cognition is generally only seen with late stages of the disease.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\"/> Diagnosed patients are seen to retain most of their cognitive functioning until the most progressive stages of the illness sets in.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\"/>\\n\\n===Physical symptoms===\\nSymptoms categorized as physically visible symptoms include [[chorea]], [[dystonia]], [[spasticity]], and [[rigidity (neurology)|rigidity]], all physical symptoms of the body associated with [[movement disorders]].<ref name = \\\"Zecca\\\"/> The symptoms accompanying neuroferritinopathy affecting movement are also progressive, becoming more generalized with time.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy- Summary of published data\\\"/> Usually during the first ten years of onset of the disease only one or two limbs are directly affected.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy- Summary of published data\\\"/>\\nDistinctive symptoms of neuroferritinopathy are chorea, found in 50% of diagnosed patients, dystonia, found in 43% of patients, and [[parkinsonism]], found in 7.5% of patients.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\"/> Full control of upper limbs on the body generally remains until late onset of the disease.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\"/> Over time, symptoms seen in a patient can change from one side of the body to the opposite side of the body, jumping from left to right or vice versa.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\"/> Another route that the physically visible symptoms have been observed to take is the appearance, disappearance, and then reappearance once more of specific symptoms.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\"/>\\n\\nWhile these symptoms are the classic indicators of neuroferritinopathy, symptoms will vary from patient to patient.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\"/>\\n\\n==Causes==\\nNeuroferritinopathy results from abnormal brain iron accumulation. This iron accumulation is due to mutations in the FTL polypeptide, which is responsible for encoding proteins involved in iron metabolism. Neuroferritinopathy is most commonly caused by a single insertion of the nucleotide adenine into the gene for L-chain ferritin which in turn, alters the [[carboxylic acid|carboxyl]] end of the entire protein chain.<ref name = \\\"Zecca\\\"/> However, exact location of the insertion in the [[exon]] varies by family.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy- Summary of published data\\\" /> Neuroferritinopathy may also be caused by the insertion of two extra nucleotide bases. The insertion of bases into the L-chain ferritin gene causes the chain to lengthen and alter the sequence of the amino acids found in the gene, also known as a [[frameshift mutation]].<ref name = \\\"Zecca\\\"/>\\n\\nThese mutations result in decreased iron-binding ability.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\" /> The oxidative damage caused by increased iron leads to [[apoptosis]], or programmed cell death.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\" /> Accumulation of iron in the brain is extremely dangerous as excess iron catalyzes the formation of [[radical surgery|free radicals]], which have damaging effects to the brain.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\"/> The iron accumulation characteristic of neuroferritinopathy particularly affects the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and motor cortex regions of the brain.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\"/>\\n\\n==Mechanism==\\nThe protein [[ferritin]] functions to sequester and release iron, acting as an iron buffering system in cells. Iron is essential to brain function in oxygen transport and cellular metabolism for example. However, careful control of iron is important as increased brain iron levels catalyze the formation of [[radical (chemistry)|free radicals]] that create oxidative molecules via the [[Fenton's reagent|Fenton Reaction]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Batista-Nascimento|first1=Liliana|last2=Pimentel|first2=Catarina|last3=Andrade Menezes|first3=Regina|last4=Rodrigues-Pousada|first4=Claudina|title=Iron and Neurodegeneration: From Cellular Homeostasis to Disease|journal=Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity|date=2012|volume=2012|pages=128647|doi=10.1155/2012/128647|pmid=22701145|pmc=3369498}}</ref> These oxidative molecules can cause oxidative brain damage.

These fall into two categories: diagnostic findings and physically visible symptoms.\\n\\n===Diagnostic findings===\\nSymptoms categorized as medically tested and diagnosed include iron accumulation in the brain, basal ganglia [[cavitation]], and [[neurodegeneration]].<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy- Summary of published data\\\"/> Patients who are diagnosed with neuroferritinopathy have abnormal iron accumulation in the brain within the [[neurons]] and [[glia]] of the [[striatum]] and cerebellar cortices.<ref name = \\\"Zecca\\\"/> Along with the accumulation of iron in the brain, neuroferritinopathy typically causes severe neuronal loss as well.<ref name = \\\"Zecca\\\"/> \\nSecondary symptoms may also arise. It is possible that the initial iron accumulation will cause additional neuronal damage and neuronal death.<ref name = \\\"Zecca\\\"/> The damaged neurons may be replaced by other cells in an effort to reverse the neurodegeneration. These cells often have a higher iron content. The breakdown of the [[blood brain barrier]] may also occur due to the loss of neurons and will subsequently allow more iron to access the brain and accumulate over time.<ref name = \\\"Zecca\\\"/>\\n\\nNeuroferritinopathy is mainly seen in those who have reached late adulthood and is generally seen to slowly progress throughout many decades in a lifetime with the mean age of onset being 39 years old.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\"/> A loss of cognition is generally only seen with late stages of the disease.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\"/> Diagnosed patients are seen to retain most of their cognitive functioning until the most progressive stages of the illness sets in.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\"/>\\n\\n===Physical symptoms===\\nSymptoms categorized as physically visible symptoms include [[chorea]], [[dystonia]], [[spasticity]], and [[rigidity (neurology)|rigidity]], all physical symptoms of the body associated with [[movement disorders]].<ref name = \\\"Zecca\\\"/> The symptoms accompanying neuroferritinopathy affecting movement are also progressive, becoming more generalized with time.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy- Summary of published data\\\"/> Usually during the first ten years of onset of the disease only one or two limbs are directly affected.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy- Summary of published data\\\"/>\\nDistinctive symptoms of neuroferritinopathy are chorea, found in 50% of diagnosed patients, dystonia, found in 43% of patients, and [[parkinsonism]], found in 7.5% of patients.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\"/> Full control of upper limbs on the body generally remains until late onset of the disease.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\"/> Over time, symptoms seen in a patient can change from one side of the body to the opposite side of the body, jumping from left to right or vice versa.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\"/> Another route that the physically visible symptoms have been observed to take is the appearance, disappearance, and then reappearance once more of specific symptoms.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\"/>\\n\\nWhile these symptoms are the classic indicators of neuroferritinopathy, symptoms will vary from patient to patient.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\"/>\\n\\n==Causes==\\nNeuroferritinopathy results from abnormal brain iron accumulation. This iron accumulation is due to mutations in the FTL polypeptide, which is responsible for encoding proteins involved in iron metabolism. Neuroferritinopathy is most commonly caused by a single insertion of the nucleotide adenine into the gene for L-chain ferritin which in turn, alters the [[carboxylic acid|carboxyl]] end of the entire protein chain.<ref name = \\\"Zecca\\\"/> However, exact location of the insertion in the [[exon]] varies by family.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy- Summary of published data\\\" /> Neuroferritinopathy may also be caused by the insertion of two extra nucleotide bases. The insertion of bases into the L-chain ferritin gene causes the chain to lengthen and alter the sequence of the amino acids found in the gene, also known as a [[frameshift mutation]].<ref name = \\\"Zecca\\\"/>\\n\\nThese mutations result in decreased iron-binding ability.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\" /> The oxidative damage caused by increased iron leads to [[apoptosis]], or programmed cell death.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\" /> Accumulation of iron in the brain is extremely dangerous as excess iron catalyzes the formation of [[radical surgery|free radicals]], which have damaging effects to the brain.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\"/> The iron accumulation characteristic of neuroferritinopathy particularly affects the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and motor cortex regions of the brain.<ref name=\\\"Neuroferritinopathy-Current understanding review\\\"/>\\n\\n==Mechanism==\\nThe protein [[ferritin]] functions to sequester and release iron, acting as an iron buffering system in cells. Iron is essential to brain function in oxygen transport and cellular metabolism for example. However, careful control of iron is important as increased brain iron levels catalyze the formation of [[radical (chemistry)|free radicals]] that create oxidative molecules via the [[Fenton's reagent|Fenton Reaction]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Batista-Nascimento|first1=Liliana|last2=Pimentel|first2=Catarina|last3=Andrade Menezes|first3=Regina|last4=Rodrigues-Pousada|first4=Claudina|title=Iron and Neurodegeneration: From Cellular Homeostasis to Disease|journal=Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity|date=2012|volume=2012|pages=128647|doi=10.1155/2012/128647|pmid=22701145|pmc=3369498}}</ref> These oxidative molecules can cause oxidative brain damage.
