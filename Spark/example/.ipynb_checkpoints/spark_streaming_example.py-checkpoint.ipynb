Quigg suffered a cut over his left eye in round 5 which caused him issues later in the fight whereas Valdez after having his mouth busted, was seen with blood pouring out in the second half of the fight.

Quigg suffered a cut over his left eye in round 5 which caused him issues later in the fight whereas Valdez after having his mouth busted, was seen with blood pouring out in the second half of the fight.

He fought for the world heavyweight championship in 1975, losing on points in a second bout with Ali.\\n\\nBugner retired from boxing in 1976, but over the next two decades he made sporadic comebacks with varying success. He moved to Australia in 1986, adopting the nickname \\\"Aussie Joe\\\", beating fighters such as [[Greg Page (boxer)|Greg Page]], [[David Bey]], [[Anders Eklund]] and [[James Tillis]] before retiring again after a TKO loss to [[Frank Bruno]] in 1987. He made a final comeback during the 1990s, winning the Australian heavyweight title in 1995 and the lightly regarded World Boxing Federation (WBF) heavyweight championship in 1998 at the age of 48 against [[James \\\"Bonecrusher\\\" Smith]].

He turned professional in 1967 (at the unusually young age of seventeen) on the advice of his then trainer and friend Andy Smith. Smith was unhappy with the choice of Bugner's opponents and believed that he could better control the quality of his opponents if Bugner turned professional.<ref>[http://ringsidereport.com/rsr/news.php?readmore=1586 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011213100/http://ringsidereport.com/rsr/news.php?readmore=1586 |date=11 October 2007 }}</ref> He had a losing debut against Paul Brown on 20 December 1967 at the [[London Hilton]], where he suffered a TKO in the third round. Showing gritty determination, after his debut the teenage Bugner went on to win a remarkable 18 consecutive fights in under two years during 1968 and 1969 (including 13 stoppage victories) before narrowly losing to the older and vastly more experienced Dick Hall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxrec.com/boxer_display.php?boxer_id=000924 |title=Joe Bugner : Boxer |publisher=Boxrec.com |accessdate=25 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021117154205/http://www.boxrec.com/boxer_display.php?boxer_id=000924 |archivedate=17 November 2002 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He bounced back and rounded off the 1960s with three further stoppage victories.\\n\\n===1970s===\\nIn 1970 Bugner emerged internationally as an outstanding young prospect, and by the end of the year he was world-rated. He won nine consecutive bouts that year, including victories over well-known boxers such as [[Chuck Wepner]], [[Manuel Ramos (boxer)|Manuel Ramos]], [[Johnny Prescott]], [[Brian London]], [[Eduardo Corletti]], [[Alberto Lovell]], [[Charley Polite]], and [[George Johnson (boxer)|George Johnson]].\\n\\nBugner was now positioned to challenge world-rated Englishman [[Henry Cooper (boxer)|Henry Cooper]], who had nearly knocked out [[Muhammad Ali]] a few years previously, for Cooper's [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] and [[Europe]]an titles. However, because Bugner was still too young to fight for the British Commonwealth title (the minimum age was twenty-one years old at the time), this much anticipated bout had to be postponed until the next year. While waiting to come of age, in 1971 he defeated Carl Gizzi and just weeks later and weeks before facing Cooper, drew with Bill Drover.\\n\\nEarly in his professional years Bugner earned a reputation as a tough, durable but often exceptionally defensive and cautious boxer; he retained that image for the rest of his career. He was criticised often for lacking natural aggression in the ring. Some observers argued that Bugner's heart was never in boxing after an early opponent, Ulric Regis, died from [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injuries]] soon after being outpointed by Bugner at [[London]]'s [[Shoreditch Town Hall]]. Many{{who|date=January 2017}} said that Bugner never punched his full weight after that.\\n\\n====Defeat of Henry Cooper====\\nIn March 1971 Bugner finally met veteran [[Henry Cooper (boxer)|Cooper]], and won a fifteen-round decision. Bugner won the bout by the slimmest of margins, 1/4 point, on the card of the lone official, [[Harry Gibbs (referee)|Harry Gibbs]]. The British sporting public and press were deeply divided about the verdict. Many felt that Cooper deserved the decision due to his steady aggression. But Bugner fought effectively on the defense and scored often with his left jab, and in the opinion of many, was the rightful winner of the bout. ''[[The Times]]'', among others, scored the fight in favour of Bugner. Still, the outcome of the bout is regarded as one of the most controversial in British boxing history.\\n\\nNonetheless, Bugner was now the [[List of British heavyweight boxing champions|British]], British Commonwealth, and European champion, and for the first time he was ranked among the world's top ten heavyweights. Bugner would remain in the world ratings until his first retirement in 1976.\\n\\nBugner retained his European title with a decision over tough German heavyweight [[J\\u00fcrgen Blin]].\\n\\nHowever, later in 1971 Bugner surprisingly lost decisions to underdogs [[Jack Bodell]] and Larry Middleton; sandwiched between these losses was a victory over Mike Boswell. The Bodell fight was particularly costly, depriving Bugner of his British, British Commonwealth and European championships. Bugner's relative inexperience, his youth and lack of an extensive amateur background, (and possibly the lingering controversy surrounding the Cooper fight), were the chief causes of these defeats.\\n\\nIn 1972 Bugner won eight consecutive fights, including a knockout over J\\u00fcrgen Blin for the European championship, an impressive knockout against the tough Tony Doyle (who had beaten [[Thad Spencer]] and Terry Daniels, and had taken [[Jerry Quarry]] the distance) and had further KO's over the then-unbeaten Doug Kirk and the useful Italian Dante Cane in defence of his European title.  By the end of that year, Bugner had acquired sufficient seasoning as a boxer, that his manager began seeking matches against the world's best heavyweights.\\n\\n====Prime years====\\nIn 1973 Bugner began the year by retaining his European belt with a victory over the capable Dutchman [[Rudie Lubbers]]. The 23-year-old Bugner then lost twelve-round decisions to [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Joe Frazier]]. Although the scorecards in the Ali fight were somewhat lopsided, Bugner fought well, and he won the respect of the boxing media and public alike. After their bout, Ali declared that Bugner was capable of being world champion.<ref>{{cite news | date=26 February 1973 | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1087092/index.htm | title=Ali In A World Of His Own | publisher=Sports Illustrated | accessdate=24 November 2009 }}</ref> Ali's trainer [[Angelo Dundee]] later echoed that sentiment.<ref>{{cite news | date=1 March 1976 | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1090798/index.htm | title=The Next Stop Is Costa Rica | publisher=Sports Illustrated | accessdate=24 November 2009 }}</ref> The fight with Frazier in July 1973 at [[Earls Court]] in London was deemed a classic. After being knocked down by a tremendous left hook in the tenth round, Bugner arose and staggered Frazier to close the round. Frazier took the decision, but only narrowly, and arguably only [[George Foreman]] and [[Muhammad Ali]] ever gave Frazier a harder fight. Many regard the Frazier bout as being Bugner's best career performance.\\n\\nAfter the Ali and Frazier fights, Bugner won a further 8 bouts in a row, his most notable victories being over top contender and ex-WBA World Heavyweight Champion [[Jimmy Ellis (boxer)|Jimmy Ellis]], the highly rated [[Mac Foster]], and European title defences against [[Giuseppe Ros]], Dante Cane and Mario Baruzzi. By the end of 1974 Bugner was rated among the top five heavyweight contenders in the world.\\n\\nBugner challenged [[Muhammad Ali]] for the world championship in June 1975, the bout being held in [[Kuala Lumpur]], with Ali winning a relatively one-sided fifteen-round decision. Bugner performed fairly well, but maintained a strictly defensive posture throughout most of this fight, perhaps due to the blistering tropical heat, and as a result he was widely scorned by the media and public. In an interview during an April 2008 reunion with Henry Cooper, Bugner defended his tactics in the Ali fight as having been necessary due to the extreme temperature and humidity of the outside venue.\\n\\n====Regains British, European & Commonwealth titles====\\n\\nEarly in 1976, Bugner announced his retirement from boxing, stating that he no longer felt motivated to fight professionally. Within months however he returned to the ring, expressing disgust at Richard Dunn's performance against Ali and in October he blasted out [[Richard Dunn (boxer)|Richard Dunn]] in the first round to reclaim the British, British Commonwealth and European championships. Onlookers state that they had never seen Bugner angry before, and that while Dunn's supporters had waged a quite unsportsmanlike campaign against Bugner, if he had fought like that in his earller career he could have gone further.\\n\\nIn 1977, Bugner lost a close twelve-round decision away from home to top contender [[Ron Lyle]]. The scores were 57\\u201353 and 56\\u201354 for Lyle against 55\\u201354 for Bugner. After this bout, Bugner again retired, making only sporadic comebacks to the ring over the next decades.\\n\\n===1980s===\\nBugner returned to the ring for brief periods in the 1980s and 1990s, but due to the effects of age and inactivity, he was never again as effective as he had been during his prime.\\n\\nAfter a three-year absence from the ring, Bugner returned in May 1980, knocking out fringe contender Gilberto Acuna, before promptly retiring again. In 1982, a ring rusty Bugner (having had only one short fight in 5 years and weighing in some 25&nbsp;lbs above his prime fighting weight) fought the hard-hitting top contender [[Earnie Shavers]], but was stopped in the second round due to a badly cut eye. However, Bugner decided to continue his comeback, stopping the useful John Denis and fringe contender Danny Sutton, as well as domestic contenders Winston Allen and Eddie Neilson. In 1983, a subdued and unmotivated Bugner lost to [[Marvis Frazier]], showing little ambition throughout the bout. He followed this with a decision over future European champion [[Anders Eklund]] and a controversial loss to future World Title challenger [[Steffen Tangstad]]. Bugner appeared to have done enough to win the Tangstad fight, however, like with the Frazier and Eklund bouts, he appeared unmotivated and uninterested throughout.\\n\\n====Comeback in Australia====\\nIn 1986 Bugner moved to [[Australia]], where he adopted the nickname ''Aussie Joe'' after taking out dual British-Australian nationality.<ref name=\\\"b-m\\\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxing-monthly.co.uk/content/9908/two.htm |title=Article Two - August 1999 |publisher=Boxing Monthly |accessdate=25 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620182922/http://www.boxing-monthly.co.uk/content/9908/two.htm |archivedate=20 June 2012 }}</ref> In Australia, Bugner launched a fairly successful comeback, earning good victories over world title contenders [[James Tillis]] and [[David Bey]] and an impressive victory over former [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] heavyweight champion [[Greg Page (boxer)|Greg Page]], gaining a world ranking in the process, after which he spoke of challenging reigning heavyweight champion [[Mike Tyson]].<ref>{{cite news | date=3 August 1987 | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1066234/1/index.htm | title=Scorecard | publisher=Sports Illustrated | accessdate=26 November 2009 }}</ref> However, there was great clamour for a fight with fellow Briton [[Frank Bruno]]. The bout was touted as the biggest all-British heavyweight bout since Cooper Vs Bugner in 1971. The bout took place in late 1987, and Bugner suffered an eighth-round TKO loss to the much younger and fresher world title contender for the Commonwealth championship in front of a huge crowd at [[White Hart Lane]] football stadium. Bugner promptly retired again following this defeat, only his 3rd stoppage defeat in 20 years.\\n\\n===1990s===\\n\\nInspired by the 45-year-old [[George Foreman]]'s recapture of the heavyweight title, Bugner made a final comeback in 1995, beating Vince Cervi to win the Australian heavyweight title, followed by a win over West Turner. Bugner then fought fellow Briton and world title contender [[Scott Welch]] for the WBO Intercontinental Heavyweight Title. Welch proved too young and fresh for the now 46-year-old Bugner, handing him a TKO defeat in the 6th round.\\n\\nBugner continued to fight on against far younger opponents. In 1996 he defeated the respectable Young Haumona for the Pacific and Australasian Heavyweight title, retained it against Waisiki Ligaloa in 1997, added the Australian title by defeating the tough [[Colin Wilson]] and defending both titles against [[Bob Mirovic]] in 1998.\\n\\nIn 1998 Bugner's long-term tenacity finally gave him a world crown, albeit a lightly regarded title - the WBF version of the heavyweight crown  - by defeating former WBA World Heavyweight Champion [[James \\\"Bonecrusher\\\" Smith]]. At the age of 48 years and 110 days, it made him the oldest ever boxer to hold a world [[championship belt]].<ref>[http://www.sunnewsonline.com/webpages/sports/2006/jan/24/sports-24-1-2006-005.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821020646/http://www.sunnewsonline.com/webpages/sports/2006/jan/24/sports-24-1-2006-005.htm |date=21 August 2007 }}</ref><ref>[http://members.fortunecity.com/taletape/bugner.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013035245/http://members.fortunecity.com/taletape/bugner.htm |date=13 October 2004 }}</ref> .\\n\\nBugner was to fight just once more, in 1999 at the age of 49 he defeated the durable fringe contender Levi Billups, after which he finally retired for good.\\n\\n==Fight record==\\nHis record for 83 professional fights is 69 wins (41 on knockouts), 13 Losses and 1 Draw.

He was ranked among the world's top ten heavyweights in the 1970s, fighting such opponents as [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Joe Frazier]], [[Ron Lyle]], [[Jimmy Ellis (boxer)|Jimmy Ellis]], [[Manuel Ramos (boxer)|Manuel Ramos]], [[Chuck Wepner]], [[Earnie Shavers]], [[Henry Cooper (boxer)|Henry Cooper]], [[Brian London]], [[Mac Foster]], [[Rudie Lubbers]], [[Eduardo Corletti]], [[Jurgen Blin]] and [[George Johnson (boxer)|George Johnson]]. He fought for the world heavyweight championship in 1975, losing on points in a second bout with Ali.\\n\\nBugner retired from boxing in 1976, but over the next two decades he made sporadic comebacks with varying success. He moved to Australia in 1986, adopting the nickname \\\"Aussie Joe\\\", beating fighters such as [[Greg Page (boxer)|Greg Page]], [[David Bey]], [[Anders Eklund]] and [[James Tillis]] before retiring again after a TKO loss to [[Frank Bruno]] in 1987. He made a final comeback during the 1990s, winning the Australian heavyweight title in 1995 and the lightly regarded World Boxing Federation (WBF) heavyweight championship in 1998 at the age of 48 against [[James \\\"Bonecrusher\\\" Smith]]. He retired for the last time in 1999 with a final record of 69-13-1, including 43 wins by knockout.\\n\\n==Early years==\\nBugner and his family fled to the [[United Kingdom]] in the late 1950s because of the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary in 1956 after the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956|Hungarian Uprising]] of that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php/Joe_Bugner |title=Joe Bugner - Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia |publisher=Boxrec.com |date=28 March 2012 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> Initially he was one of about 80 refugees housed in the students Hostel at Smedley's factory in [[Wisbech]]. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Smedley|first=Michael|title=Smedley's in Wisbech|journal=Annual Report|volume=52|pages=7-11|year=1991|publisher=Wisbech Society}}</ref>They settled in the [[Huntingdonshire]]<!-- Do not change to Cambridgeshire; St Ives was part of Huntingdonshire at the time --> town of [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]]  near the [[Fens]], and so, as local custom dictated, he was known as a [[Fen Tiger (disambiguation)|Fen Tiger]].

He turned professional in 1967 (at the unusually young age of seventeen) on the advice of his then trainer and friend Andy Smith. Smith was unhappy with the choice of Bugner's opponents and believed that he could better control the quality of his opponents if Bugner turned professional.<ref>[http://ringsidereport.com/rsr/news.php?readmore=1586 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011213100/http://ringsidereport.com/rsr/news.php?readmore=1586 |date=11 October 2007 }}</ref> He had a losing debut against Paul Brown on 20 December 1967 at the [[London Hilton]], where he suffered a TKO in the third round. Showing gritty determination, after his debut the teenage Bugner went on to win a remarkable 18 consecutive fights in under two years during 1968 and 1969 (including 13 stoppage victories) before narrowly losing to the older and vastly more experienced Dick Hall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxrec.com/boxer_display.php?boxer_id=000924 |title=Joe Bugner : Boxer |publisher=Boxrec.com |accessdate=25 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021117154205/http://www.boxrec.com/boxer_display.php?boxer_id=000924 |archivedate=17 November 2002 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He bounced back and rounded off the 1960s with three further stoppage victories.\\n\\n===1970s===\\nIn 1970 Bugner emerged internationally as an outstanding young prospect, and by the end of the year he was world-rated. He won nine consecutive bouts that year, including victories over well-known boxers such as [[Chuck Wepner]], [[Manuel Ramos (boxer)|Manuel Ramos]], [[Johnny Prescott]], [[Brian London]], [[Eduardo Corletti]], [[Alberto Lovell]], [[Charley Polite]], and [[George Johnson (boxer)|George Johnson]].\\n\\nBugner was now positioned to challenge world-rated Englishman [[Henry Cooper (boxer)|Henry Cooper]], who had nearly knocked out [[Muhammad Ali]] a few years previously, for Cooper's [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] and [[Europe]]an titles. However, because Bugner was still too young to fight for the British Commonwealth title (the minimum age was twenty-one years old at the time), this much anticipated bout had to be postponed until the next year. While waiting to come of age, in 1971 he defeated Carl Gizzi and just weeks later and weeks before facing Cooper, drew with Bill Drover.\\n\\nEarly in his professional years Bugner earned a reputation as a tough, durable but often exceptionally defensive and cautious boxer; he retained that image for the rest of his career. He was criticised often for lacking natural aggression in the ring. Some observers argued that Bugner's heart was never in boxing after an early opponent, Ulric Regis, died from [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injuries]] soon after being outpointed by Bugner at [[London]]'s [[Shoreditch Town Hall]]. Many{{who|date=January 2017}} said that Bugner never punched his full weight after that.\\n\\n====Defeat of Henry Cooper====\\nIn March 1971 Bugner finally met veteran [[Henry Cooper (boxer)|Cooper]], and won a fifteen-round decision. Bugner won the bout by the slimmest of margins, 1/4 point, on the card of the lone official, [[Harry Gibbs (referee)|Harry Gibbs]]. The British sporting public and press were deeply divided about the verdict. Many felt that Cooper deserved the decision due to his steady aggression. But Bugner fought effectively on the defense and scored often with his left jab, and in the opinion of many, was the rightful winner of the bout. ''[[The Times]]'', among others, scored the fight in favour of Bugner. Still, the outcome of the bout is regarded as one of the most controversial in British boxing history.\\n\\nNonetheless, Bugner was now the [[List of British heavyweight boxing champions|British]], British Commonwealth, and European champion, and for the first time he was ranked among the world's top ten heavyweights. Bugner would remain in the world ratings until his first retirement in 1976.\\n\\nBugner retained his European title with a decision over tough German heavyweight [[J\\u00fcrgen Blin]].\\n\\nHowever, later in 1971 Bugner surprisingly lost decisions to underdogs [[Jack Bodell]] and Larry Middleton; sandwiched between these losses was a victory over Mike Boswell. The Bodell fight was particularly costly, depriving Bugner of his British, British Commonwealth and European championships. Bugner's relative inexperience, his youth and lack of an extensive amateur background, (and possibly the lingering controversy surrounding the Cooper fight), were the chief causes of these defeats.\\n\\nIn 1972 Bugner won eight consecutive fights, including a knockout over J\\u00fcrgen Blin for the European championship, an impressive knockout against the tough Tony Doyle (who had beaten [[Thad Spencer]] and Terry Daniels, and had taken [[Jerry Quarry]] the distance) and had further KO's over the then-unbeaten Doug Kirk and the useful Italian Dante Cane in defence of his European title.  By the end of that year, Bugner had acquired sufficient seasoning as a boxer, that his manager began seeking matches against the world's best heavyweights.\\n\\n====Prime years====\\nIn 1973 Bugner began the year by retaining his European belt with a victory over the capable Dutchman [[Rudie Lubbers]]. The 23-year-old Bugner then lost twelve-round decisions to [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Joe Frazier]]. Although the scorecards in the Ali fight were somewhat lopsided, Bugner fought well, and he won the respect of the boxing media and public alike. After their bout, Ali declared that Bugner was capable of being world champion.<ref>{{cite news | date=26 February 1973 | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1087092/index.htm | title=Ali In A World Of His Own | publisher=Sports Illustrated | accessdate=24 November 2009 }}</ref> Ali's trainer [[Angelo Dundee]] later echoed that sentiment.<ref>{{cite news | date=1 March 1976 | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1090798/index.htm | title=The Next Stop Is Costa Rica | publisher=Sports Illustrated | accessdate=24 November 2009 }}</ref> The fight with Frazier in July 1973 at [[Earls Court]] in London was deemed a classic. After being knocked down by a tremendous left hook in the tenth round, Bugner arose and staggered Frazier to close the round. Frazier took the decision, but only narrowly, and arguably only [[George Foreman]] and [[Muhammad Ali]] ever gave Frazier a harder fight. Many regard the Frazier bout as being Bugner's best career performance.\\n\\nAfter the Ali and Frazier fights, Bugner won a further 8 bouts in a row, his most notable victories being over top contender and ex-WBA World Heavyweight Champion [[Jimmy Ellis (boxer)|Jimmy Ellis]], the highly rated [[Mac Foster]], and European title defences against [[Giuseppe Ros]], Dante Cane and Mario Baruzzi. By the end of 1974 Bugner was rated among the top five heavyweight contenders in the world.\\n\\nBugner challenged [[Muhammad Ali]] for the world championship in June 1975, the bout being held in [[Kuala Lumpur]], with Ali winning a relatively one-sided fifteen-round decision. Bugner performed fairly well, but maintained a strictly defensive posture throughout most of this fight, perhaps due to the blistering tropical heat, and as a result he was widely scorned by the media and public. In an interview during an April 2008 reunion with Henry Cooper, Bugner defended his tactics in the Ali fight as having been necessary due to the extreme temperature and humidity of the outside venue.\\n\\n====Regains British, European & Commonwealth titles====\\n\\nEarly in 1976, Bugner announced his retirement from boxing, stating that he no longer felt motivated to fight professionally. Within months however he returned to the ring, expressing disgust at Richard Dunn's performance against Ali and in October he blasted out [[Richard Dunn (boxer)|Richard Dunn]] in the first round to reclaim the British, British Commonwealth and European championships. Onlookers state that they had never seen Bugner angry before, and that while Dunn's supporters had waged a quite unsportsmanlike campaign against Bugner, if he had fought like that in his earller career he could have gone further.\\n\\nIn 1977, Bugner lost a close twelve-round decision away from home to top contender [[Ron Lyle]]. The scores were 57\\u201353 and 56\\u201354 for Lyle against 55\\u201354 for Bugner. After this bout, Bugner again retired, making only sporadic comebacks to the ring over the next decades.\\n\\n===1980s===\\nBugner returned to the ring for brief periods in the 1980s and 1990s, but due to the effects of age and inactivity, he was never again as effective as he had been during his prime.\\n\\nAfter a three-year absence from the ring, Bugner returned in May 1980, knocking out fringe contender Gilberto Acuna, before promptly retiring again. In 1982, a ring rusty Bugner (having had only one short fight in 5 years and weighing in some 25&nbsp;lbs above his prime fighting weight) fought the hard-hitting top contender [[Earnie Shavers]], but was stopped in the second round due to a badly cut eye. However, Bugner decided to continue his comeback, stopping the useful John Denis and fringe contender Danny Sutton, as well as domestic contenders Winston Allen and Eddie Neilson. In 1983, a subdued and unmotivated Bugner lost to [[Marvis Frazier]], showing little ambition throughout the bout. He followed this with a decision over future European champion [[Anders Eklund]] and a controversial loss to future World Title challenger [[Steffen Tangstad]]. Bugner appeared to have done enough to win the Tangstad fight, however, like with the Frazier and Eklund bouts, he appeared unmotivated and uninterested throughout.\\n\\n====Comeback in Australia====\\nIn 1986 Bugner moved to [[Australia]], where he adopted the nickname ''Aussie Joe'' after taking out dual British-Australian nationality.<ref name=\\\"b-m\\\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxing-monthly.co.uk/content/9908/two.htm |title=Article Two - August 1999 |publisher=Boxing Monthly |accessdate=25 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620182922/http://www.boxing-monthly.co.uk/content/9908/two.htm |archivedate=20 June 2012 }}</ref> In Australia, Bugner launched a fairly successful comeback, earning good victories over world title contenders [[James Tillis]] and [[David Bey]] and an impressive victory over former [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] heavyweight champion [[Greg Page (boxer)|Greg Page]], gaining a world ranking in the process, after which he spoke of challenging reigning heavyweight champion [[Mike Tyson]].<ref>{{cite news | date=3 August 1987 | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1066234/1/index.htm | title=Scorecard | publisher=Sports Illustrated | accessdate=26 November 2009 }}</ref> However, there was great clamour for a fight with fellow Briton [[Frank Bruno]]. The bout was touted as the biggest all-British heavyweight bout since Cooper Vs Bugner in 1971. The bout took place in late 1987, and Bugner suffered an eighth-round TKO loss to the much younger and fresher world title contender for the Commonwealth championship in front of a huge crowd at [[White Hart Lane]] football stadium. Bugner promptly retired again following this defeat, only his 3rd stoppage defeat in 20 years.\\n\\n===1990s===\\n\\nInspired by the 45-year-old [[George Foreman]]'s recapture of the heavyweight title, Bugner made a final comeback in 1995, beating Vince Cervi to win the Australian heavyweight title, followed by a win over West Turner. Bugner then fought fellow Briton and world title contender [[Scott Welch]] for the WBO Intercontinental Heavyweight Title. Welch proved too young and fresh for the now 46-year-old Bugner, handing him a TKO defeat in the 6th round.\\n\\nBugner continued to fight on against far younger opponents. In 1996 he defeated the respectable Young Haumona for the Pacific and Australasian Heavyweight title, retained it against Waisiki Ligaloa in 1997, added the Australian title by defeating the tough [[Colin Wilson]] and defending both titles against [[Bob Mirovic]] in 1998.\\n\\nIn 1998 Bugner's long-term tenacity finally gave him a world crown, albeit a lightly regarded title - the WBF version of the heavyweight crown  - by defeating former WBA World Heavyweight Champion [[James \\\"Bonecrusher\\\" Smith]]. At the age of 48 years and 110 days, it made him the oldest ever boxer to hold a world [[championship belt]].<ref>[http://www.sunnewsonline.com/webpages/sports/2006/jan/24/sports-24-1-2006-005.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821020646/http://www.sunnewsonline.com/webpages/sports/2006/jan/24/sports-24-1-2006-005.htm |date=21 August 2007 }}</ref><ref>[http://members.fortunecity.com/taletape/bugner.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013035245/http://members.fortunecity.com/taletape/bugner.htm |date=13 October 2004 }}</ref> .\\n\\nBugner was to fight just once more, in 1999 at the age of 49 he defeated the durable fringe contender Levi Billups, after which he finally retired for good.\\n\\n==Fight record==\\nHis record for 83 professional fights is 69 wins (41 on knockouts), 13 Losses and 1 Draw.
